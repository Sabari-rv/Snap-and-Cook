This is because condensed milk tends to get stuck to the bottom and sides of the pan and burn; leading to a very unpleasant taste. Burning of milk is also toxic so you want to be extra careful.Once it the milk is reduced to more than half of its quantity, stir in the sugar until it dissolves completely.

Add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead for a few more minutes until smooth.Set the millet phulka dough aside to rest covered for 15 minutes. Knead once again and divide the dough into 8 portions.Preheat the iron skillet on medium high heat. Roll the portions of phulka (roti) dough into balls; flatten these balls with the palm of your hand.Take a portion of the Millet phulka dough, toss it on the flour and roll out into thin circles to approximately 6 inches in diameter. As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.Cook the millet phulka as indicated in the steps below. Continue the process of rolling with the remaining portions of the dough.*Cooking Millet Phulka (Roti) on Gas StovePlace rolled dough on the hot skillet. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form. At this point flip the rolled dough to the other side on the skillet.After a few seconds turn the flame to high; using tongs take the rolled Millet phulka off the skillet and place it directly on the flame. It should balloon into a spherical shape and puff up.Remove the Millet phulka from heat, place it on a flat plate and optionally spread little ghee on the side facing up.Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the rolled Millet phulka dough and keep stacking them one over the other.*Cooking Millet Phulka (Roti) on Electric StoveThis process can be used if you are using a gas stove as well.Preheat an iron skillet. Place rolled Millet phulka dough on the hot skillet. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form. At this point flip the rolled Millet phulka dough to the other side on the skillet.Flip over again and cook the first side pressing lightly with a napkin. The rolled out phulka dough should begin to start puffing out.Flip and cook the other side for a few more seconds.Remove from the heat, place the Millet phulka on a flat plate and optionally spread little ghee on the side facing up. Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the rolled dough and keep stacking them the phulka one over the other.Serve the Mixed Millet Phulka Recipe with Spinach Paneer Kofta Curry and Dangar Pachadi With Grated Carrots to create complete healthy meal.TipMaking the rolled out phulka dough puff into a balloon comes with practice. So give yourself time if you are new to bread making.Even if yours does not puff the first time or the times after, the rotis that you have made are cooked and are edible, so you could consume them with your choice of vegetables.Using thinner rolling pins is the key, as you want to be gentle with the dough.The heavy big ones will make you press harder which might just make it tear. It’s well worth investing in a thinner rolling pin and tongs to hold the bread which is available in most Indian stores around the world.Tossing the phulka dough in flour as you roll is another helper that will make the rolling out the dough easier."

For this heat milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring the milk to a boil.Once the milk comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer the milk with almost continuous stirring and reduce the milk to more than half its quantity. It is important to note that during the initial stages of milk condensation frequent stirring is important, but as it begins to start condensing and reaches less than half the quantity it is absolutely important that you stir continuously.This is because condensed milk tends to get stuck to the bottom and sides of the pan and burn; leading to a very unpleasant taste. Burning of milk is also toxic so you want to be extra careful.Once it is reduced to about more than half of its quantity stir in the sugar until it dissolves completely. Finally stir in the cardamom powder, saffron and chopped pistachios into the Kulfi milk mixture.Turn off the heat and allow the kesar pista kulfi mixture to cool completely. Pour the kesar pista kulfi mixture in the moulds until 3/4th full, seal them airtight and freeze them in the refrigerator. The Kesar Pista Kulfi takes a good fifteen hours or more to freeze.  If you get wooden ice cream sticks in the market, you can insert them in and freeze the Kulfis.Once frozen you can run the kesar pista kulfi moulds under water to enable easy release onto the plate and serve.Serve the Kesar Pista Kulfi for your Holi or Diwali Party or when you have an elaborate Indian Dinner Menu planned for your parties.

Enure the shell does not break. Keep the shell aside.Peel the think skin of the pulp, remove any seeds and cut the pulp into tiny pieces and keep this aside.The next step is to condense the milk to make the Kulfi. For this heat milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring the milk to a boil.Once the milk comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer the milk with almost continuous stirring and reduce the milk to more than half its quantity. It is important to note that during the initial stages of milk condensation frequent stirring is important, but as it begins to start condensing and reaches less than half the quantity it is absolutely important that you stir continuously.This is because condensed milk tends to get stuck to the bottom and sides of the pan and burn; leading to a very unpleasant taste. Burning of milk is also toxic so you want to be extra careful.Once it is reduced to about more than half of its quantity stir in the sugar until it dissolves completely. Once it does, allow the kulfi milk mixture to cool completely.Once the Kulfi cools, stir in the orange marmalade and the orange pulp mixture into the condensed kulfi mixture. Pour the Orange kulfi mixture in the orange shells you kept aside or you can also set in another bowl and later serve the orange kulfi in the orange shells. I prefer the later method, as it is easier to scoop the orange kulfi like an ice cream and put it in the shells and serve it to your friends and family.Note: Freeze the orange for at least fifteen hours or more to set well. Serve the Orange Kulfi Recipe as an cold indian dessert for parties or during the festival of Holi or simply make for the summers and enjoy it with your family.

To cook basmati rice separately, wash and soak the basmati rice in water for 20 minutes.Meanwhile add about 3 litres of water in a large vessel and bring it to boil.Once water starts to boil, add about 1 teaspoon of cooking oil and 1 teaspoon of salt. Add the soaked and drained rice, stir gently once and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes (I usually take it off heat by 3-1/2 minutes).Keep an eye on rice as some brands of basmati rice cooks very fast and some takes time. My rice was cooked in 5 minutes. Drain the water immediately and spread the rice on a large plate.In a deep bottomed pan, heat oil on medium flame,  add 1 sliced onion and fry it until brown (don’t burn the onions).

Cook until chicken is fully cooked. Once chicken is cooked, if you find there is excess water, increase the flame and thicken the masala. We need the masala just to coat the chicken.Take a large wide, deep vessel, add ghee and spread it to coat all the bottom and sides of the pan, reduce the flame to low. Add about 2 full tablespoons of the thick chicken biryani masala and spread it all over the bottom.Next, add cooked basmati rice over the chicken biryani masala and gently spread the rice to cover the chicken. Use a tea spoon and remove the top oily layer from masala and drizzle over the rice, this will add flavours to the rice and also give colour.Repeat the layering process until you have used up all rice and chicken. Over the top sprinkle coriander and mint leaves and browned onions and close with a lid.Ensure the flame is low and place a heavy weight on top of lid to trap the steam inside to cook the Chicken Dum Biryani recipe. Leave the dum biryani aside for 10 minutes until all the flavors seep through.Scoop out the Chicken Dum Biryani from the edges of the pan, making sure not to break the rice grains.Serve Chicken Dum Biryani Recipe with Pickled onions, Burani Raita and Mirchi Ka Salan Recipe (Chillies in Tangy Spicy Peanut Sesame Curry) for Sunday afternoon lunch.

Let it soak for about 6 hours.Soak the urad dal and fenugreek in water such that all of the dal is completely immersed in water. Let it soak for about 6 hours.First grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter. While grinding add just enough water to make it into a very very smooth batter. The batter will look fluffy. Pour this batter into a large container.Grind the rice into a smooth paste, adding just the required amount of water to grind into a almost smooth batter. Adding too much water will make the dosa batter too watery. If required grind a little at a time to get a almost smooth batter .The rice batter is a little coarser, but the urad dal batter is super smooth.Combine the urad and rice batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the batter ferments. You will notice the batter would have risen in volume.Hence you should place the batter in a large container so it has enough room to increase in its volume.Note on fermenting the Idli Dosa BatterFermenting has to take place where the weather is warm. So ideally summer’s the batter ferments very well and doubles or triples its quantity.But in cold places, the batter has to be kept in an oven. If your oven has light, then turn on the light for a few hours with the batter in the oven.Once the oven is warm, turn off the light and let the batter ferment.If your oven does not have a light, then preheat the oven to warm, turn off oven then keep the batter in the oven to ferment.This process can be mastered with experience.Method For making idlis from the Idli Dosa BatterThe freshly fermented batter is great for making idli's.

6066,Puri For Pani Puri Recipe - Golagappa / Puchka Puri Recipe,"1 cup Sooji (Semolina/ Rava),1 tablespoon All Purpose Flour (Maida),1/2 teaspoon Salt,1 tablespoon Sunflower Oil,1/4 cup Lukewarm Water,Sunflower Oil - for deep frying",5,45,50,40,North Indian,Snack,Vegetarian,"To begin making the Puri for Pani Puri, in a large bowl, add in the salt, sooji rava and the warm water. Mix the ingredients well until the sooji rava has absorbed all the water. The mixture will resemble a wet crumb texture.With this existing moisture we need to make this into a smooth dough. For that add in a tablespoon of maida (all purpose flour). This flour is to absorb that extra moisture and give it a bit of gluten for the dough. Resist the temptation to add more flour, this will alter the texture of the puri for the pani puriKnead this dough well for about 10 minutes continuously. It will be easier to knead it on your kitchen platform rather than the bowl. You can use both your hands and muscle power to get the sooji rava mixture into a consistency of a smooth dough. The dough should not be super stiff. It should be firm, yet smooth and pliable.NOTE: Do time yourself and knead for 10 minutes and not any less (smiles)The kneading helps the dough develop the gluten and the warmth of your hand helps it get softer. This gluten will help the puri’s puff in the oil and turn crisp as well.Also note, the dough should not be soft, it should be medium tight and not hard. Hence kneading well helps give that smooth finishAfter kneading the dough for 10 minutes, add in 1 tablespoon of oil. It is important that you add the oil only after kneading the dough and not in the beginning. This will give the crunch to the dough that a puri of the pani puri should have.Knead this pani puri dough for another 3 minutes (put a timer on)Now cover the dough either in a box with a lid or invert a bowl over it. This helps the dough to sweat and form its gluten and softness. Allow the dough to rest for at least 30 minutes.Once the dough is well rested for 30 minutes, knead the dough once again for another 2 minutes (set the timer on)Once kneaded, we will now use a cookie cutter or the cap of the cocktail shaker to cut the puri’s for the pani puri.Preheat the oil for deep frying the puri for the pani puri.Divide the dough in 3 small portions. Take one portion out and keep the rest covered. Roll the dough into a thin sheet and using a cutter make rounds of the dough.I like to roll these rounds a little more with a rolling pin just to make sure you get the perfect thickness.Keep adding one puri at a time into the preheat oil and fry the puri’s on low to medium heat (not high heat), until they puff and turn golden brown on both sides.Note: The puri’s have to fry on low to medium heat to get that perfect crispness.Drain the puri’s once they turn golden brown on absorbent paper.Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the dough.Serve these  Puris with Pani to make Pani Puris | Golgappas | Puchka’s the most famous street food snack of india."
